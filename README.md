# The Milan Letter Project

![Licensed Ethically](https://img.shields.io/badge/licensed-ethically-%234baaaa)

Writer [Courtney Milan shared a draft of a letter she is sending to her state's governor (CO-US) demanding](https://twitter.com/courtneymilan/status/1266917538123767809):

* Reduced funding of police
* Prison abolition 
* And the end of cash bail

Erring on the the side of asking forgiveness rather than permission, I'm making it a template, and asking for the community to provide versions for other US States, territories, and jurisdictions, as well as translations. 

If this format of a letter works for your non-US state, province, prefecture, or other polity, please contribute versions of the letter.

## Contributing

### What we need now

* Versions of Milan's letter adapted for US states, territories, and jurisdictions 
  * Documentation on how to adapt the letter for your state, territory, or district
* Translations of the letter into Spanish and other commonly used languages in the US
* A micro-site with directions on finding a letter for one's jurisdiction and how to use it
* An accountability partner to make sure we are centering Black lives in our efforts
