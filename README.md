Writer [Courtney Milan shared a draft of a letter she is sending to her state's governor (CO-US) demanding](https://twitter.com/courtneymilan/status/1266917538123767809):

* Reduced funding of police
* Prison abolition 
* And the end of cash bail

Erring on the the side of asking forgiveness rather than permission, I'm making it a template, and asking for the community to provide versions for other US States, territories, and jurisdictions, as well as translations. 

If this format of a letter works for your non-US state, province, prefecture, or other polity, please contribute versions of the letter.
