# The Milan Letter Project

## Basics

Those who take initiative to do work for the community can decide how they do that work. If any community members hold serious concerns, they can start a proposal to halt what someone is doing.

The community's mission is to hold our governments accountable to the proposition that until Black Lives Matter, no lives matter.

This community shares a bias for action and a commitment to empowering and encouraging its members. Exceptions should be on the basis of serious ethical or moral concerns, not disagreements. Do-ers should keep in mind the best interests of the community as a whole and consult with community members when those interests are not clear.

The communities assets are distributed under the Hippocratic License. 

## Participants

A member is anyone who has actively contributed to the community's mission within the past year.

If a member believes another member is not respecting the serious concerns of others, a proposal for removal may be submitted. The proposal goes for a vote before all members for 1 week. If at least 2/3 of voting members agree with the proposal, the offending member is removed.

If a member exhibits disregard for others' serious concerns, they can be removed from the community.

## Policy

Members have a right to decide how they make their contributions, while other members have the right to object on the basis of serious concerns.

Individual members and subgroups can decide what and how they want to contribute to the community, reasonably respecting the community's precedent and the expressed opinions of others.

Community members are responsible for carrying out their own initiatives, and they will not expect any other members to do so, except by those members' own volition.

If another member holds serious ethical or moral concerns, that member can create a proposal stating clearly what actions should be prohibited. The proposal goes for a vote before all members for 1 week. If at least 2/3 of voting members agree with the proposal, it passes and becomes a policy for the community.

## Evolution

A proposal to change this Rule goes for a vote before all members for 1 week. If at least 2/3 of voting members agree with the proposal, it passes and the Rule changes accordingly.
